 # A combination between speech-recognition and weather api modules
In this script if you will say "temperature" print weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
If you say "exit" the script will stop.

##### I used these api's:
  - [speech_recognition](https://github.com/tmavre/speech_recognition "speech_recognition")
  - [weather-api](https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/weather-api "weather-apin")
